# No programming language

**No programming language, the best choice for your zero software failure.**

**No programming language** is designed to help worldwide problematic situations related to software failures. No implementation can generate nothing, and that kind of nothing cannot harm you.

In No programming language, even **No is Yes**. It means No is a subtype of Yes. Yes is the type of all enumerable (or more) things in the real world, and it's too unfair that you should maintain your software with that risk on your own charge. Fortunately in No, you can generate things of No type, a safe subset of universal things that are always decidable on finite time with any reasonable abstract machine. Yes, it means nothing. You remain safe.

So just start programming with No!

## Facts

* _No programming_ with _No language_ can make no more software failures (and so no risks of failure).
* If you use No programming language, you come to make nothing. That kind of nothing cannot harm you. You making nothing can harm yourself. No designers do not guarantee you saying No is a risk for your software development project.
* _No is Yes_ is a real concept in another type system of a programming language project in progress. That language is to be designed generating more than nothing. You can look forward to it.
